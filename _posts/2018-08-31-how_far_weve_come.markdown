As I near the end of the Object Oriented Ruby portion of the Learn.co curriculum, it's amazing to look back and see how far we have come in just a short time. It wasn't too long ago that the concept of arrays, hashes and other data structures, as well as the very notion of OOP was completely foreign to me. During my last project, I was introduced to pair programming to collaborate on the same project to reach a common goal. Our skills were tested while building a Tic Tac Toe program with working 0, 1 and 2 player game modes with an interacting CLI component. One component we struggled with was the CLI and how we would handle it being a 0, 1 or 2 player game. What we ended up doing was defining individual class methods within the Game class for each of the scenarios, which would each set local variables for the types of players (2 computers, 1 computer and 1 human, or 2 humans) and then create a new game with those respective players. It was a tough project, but seeing the fruits of your labor while playing a friend or a computer is incredibly rewarding.
