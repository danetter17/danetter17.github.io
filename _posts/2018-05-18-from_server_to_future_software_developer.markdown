It seems like just yesterday I was in the library pulling all nighters trying to pass my next exam at Michigan State University. Chugging coffee, studying organic molecules and biochemical pathways was my life, it was all I knew for 5 long years. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Human Biology in the summer of 2015 and naively thought that the job offers would start piling up. 

Flash forward to summer 2018 and I have yet to secure a job utilizing my degree and I am currently working as a server at a steakhouse in downtown Chicago. Is the money great? Sure. But at the end of the day I'm left unfulfilled, yearning to do more with my life and find an outlet to express my creativity. For years I have been interested in computer programming and would always think to myself, "How cool would it be to be a part of the next big biotech/healthtech company?", or would have "the next big idea", but didn't know how I would get there with no formal background or education in computer science. I knew that technology is the way of the future and investing in technical skills would help me achieve that goal, but I needed guidance, I needed a road map.  

Financially (and idealogically) it just wasn't feasible for me to quit my job and go back to university. Not only is pursuing a master's degree incredibly expensive and time consuming, after my experience as an undergraduate I just felt that a lot of my time/money was being spent to learn things that were not applicable to my future career aspirations. 

Enter Flatiron School's Fullstack Web Development program. After countless hours researching and comparing different bootcamp programs, Flatiron's fullstack program stuck out like a sore thumb, in a good way! Most programs force you to choose between two types of programs: a Ruby/Rails stack or a JavaScript stack. Flatiron was the ONLY school that I found offering to give you a foundation in BOTH, therefore drastically increasing your job prospects following graduation. 

Growth happens outside of your comfort zone, so be prepared to learn to be comfortable being uncomfortable because IT WILL BE WORTH IT! Nothing worthwhile comes easy, so put in the hard work, grind it out and never be afraid to ask for a helping hand.
